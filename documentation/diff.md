# Liquibase Commands: diff
The `diff` command in Liquibase allows you to compare two databases of the same type or different types to one another.

## Uses
The `diff` command is typically used at the completion of a project, because it allows you to verify all expected changes are in the changelog. The `diff` command is also useful for the following tasks:
+ Finding missing objects in your database
+ Seeing that a change was made to your database
+ Finding unexpected items in your database

## Running the diff Command
To compare two databases:
+ The first option is to run the `diff` command and pass the parameters needed for your source database and target database.  For example:
Run the following:
{% highlight bash %}
liquibase
--outputFile=mydiff.txt
--driver=oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
--classpath=ojdbc14.jar
--url="jdbc:oracle:thin:@<IP OR HOSTNAME>:<PORT>:<SERVICE NAME OR SID>"
--username=<USERNAME>
--password=<PASSWORD>
diff
--referenceUrl="jdbc:oracle:thin:@<IP OR HOSTNAME>:<PORT>:<SERVICE NAME OR SID>"
--referenceUsername=<USERNAME>
--referencePassword=<PASSWORD>
{% endhighlight %}

See the [snapshot command documentation](/documentation/snapshot.html) for an example of using a snapshot file as one of the databases being used in the command.

>**Note:** When running `diff` against two different databases, the class path property should reference both .jar files. Use the path separator that is correct
for your operating system (a semicolon on Windows, a colon on Mac or Linux). Example: `classpath: ojdbc7.jar:postgresql-42.2.8.jar`

+ Alternatively, configure the *liquibase.properties* file to include your driver class path, URL, and user authentication information for both databases.
Run the following command:
{% highlight bash %}
liquibase --outputFile=mydiff.txt diff
{% endhighlight %}
>**Note:** For information on how to configure your *liquibase.properties* file, view the [Creating & Configuring your *liquibase.properties* File](config_properties.html) topic in the knowledge base.

The `diff` command produces a list of categories along with one of the following descriptions:
+ **Missing:** The object is not on your comparison database (source database).
+ **Unexpected:** There are objects on your comparison database (source database) that are not on your reference database (target database).
+ **Changed:** The object as it exists on the source database is different than as it exists in the target database.
> **Note:** The changed description will not specify the type of change applied to your database. Run the [diffChangeLog](diffChangeLog.html) command 
to generate a changelog that will apply the changes to the target database.

Liquibase Community `diff` categories:
+ Catalog
+ Column
+ Foreign Key
+ Index
+ Primary Key
+ Schema
+ Sequence
+ Procedure
+ Unique Constraints
+ View

Liquibase Pro `diff` categories:

+ Check Constraint
+ Package
+ Package Body
+ Function
+ Trigger
+ Synonyms
>**Note:** Liquibase does not currently check Datatype length.

## Filtering diff Types
Liquibase allows you to use diffType parameters to filter the types of objects you want to compare. Multiple filters can be added 
to the parameter as a comma separated list. If no diffTypes are specified, all objects are considered.


Example: 
{% highlight bash %}
liquibase --diffTypes=tables,indexes,views diff
{% endhighlight %}
