title: Liquibase as a Job Requirement
---


Saw Liquibase as a requirement on dice.com today.


It's nice to see that it is becoming important enough to companies for them to list it as an important skill.


Either that or it is so difficult to use that companies do not think it is something that they can train new hires on in a reasonable amount of time....
