title: What would you want in a 2.0.4 release
---


Since <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/2012/02/liquibase-3-0-status-update.html">3.0 is taking longer than I was hoping</a> , it may make sense to have a 2.0.4 release with high value/easy fixes for those waiting for specific problems.


Are there existing bugs in<a href=" http://liquibase.jira.com"> http://liquibase.jira.com</a> or pull requests at <a href="http://github.com/liquibase">http://github.com/liquibase</a> that you would like to see in a 2.0.4 release?


Preference will be given to bugs/features that have patches that can simply be applied to the 2.0 branch, since I don't want to take more time away from 3.0 than I have to.
