title: Liquibase 2.0 RC2 Released
---


Wow, it has been a very long time since RC1, but we finally are ready for RC2. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://liquibase.org/download">http://liquibase.org/download</a> like usual, and I have created an '<a href="http://liquibase.org/v2_upgrade">upgrade to 2.0 guide</a>".


There have been a lot of bug fixes between RC1 and RC2 as well as some additional internal code structure and release process work done. The full 2.0 feature list is being built on the wiki at <a href="http://liquibase.org/v2_features">http://liquibase.org/v2_features</a>.


Please test it out and <a href="http://liquibase.org/forum">let us know</a> if you have any questions or problems. My goal is for this to be the final RC and to have 2.0 final out in a week or two. The maven plugin is not yet released to the maven repository as I am switching our primary location to Sonatype and that is not fully configured yet. Hopefully in the next couple days it will be available. I will also be working on testing the grails plugin with 2.0 over the next few days and will release an updated version soon.
