title: Continuous Build Server Now Availalbe
---


Thanks to the people at <a href="http://ops4j.org">ops4j.org</a> loaning us some space on their build server, we now have a <a href="http://ci.ops4j.org/browse/LQB">build server available</a>. It will (and has) helped ensure we keep our tests clean, and provides a place where anyone can download the <a href="http://ci.ops4j.org/browse/LQB-DEF/latest/artifact">latest build of liquibase.</a>


We would like to thank Damian Golda in particular for helping getting us set up with the ops4j people.
