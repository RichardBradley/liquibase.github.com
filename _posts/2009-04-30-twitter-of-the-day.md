> @leopinheiro: I want to use Liquibase with Rails (like a plugin), any idea?

When I started Liquibase, <a href="http://w.liquibase.org/2007/06/the-problem-with-rails-active-migrations.html">I quickly threw out the idea of creating a Java port of Rail's Migrations</a>.  Over the years, a common question is "why doesn't this work like Migrations?"  It is nice to see at least one person in the Rails community that sees the light :)
