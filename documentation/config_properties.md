Creating a *liquibase.properties* file allows you to store properties that don't change often in a *liquibase.properties* file. You can also use parameters to specify your database connection information so Liquibase can access your database and save you the trouble of passing along command line arguments.

#### Creating the File
To create a *liquibase.properties* file, generate a new text file in your project Liquibase directory and name it *liquibase.properties*.

> Note: The file can also be named something other than liquibase.properties and/or be in a completely different directory by using the --defaultsFile parameter during runtime.
To learn more please see [Liquibase Command Line](command_line.html).

## Parameters
The most common properties that you might set in the *liquibase.properties* are listed below. Any parameter that could be specified on
the command line can also be specified in the properties file. If a parameter is specified in both the properties file and the command line,
the command line value will override the value in the file.

| Parameter | Definition |
| --------- | ---------- |
| changeLogFile | The path for your changelog file|
| driver | The driver class name for your source database|
| url | The primary database when doing an update, or the source database for performing comparisons. |
| username | The username for your source database.|
| password | The password for your source database.|
| referenceDriver | The driver class name for your target database. |
| referenceUrl | The database you want to use to compare to your source database. Also known as your target. |
| referenceUsername | The username for your target database. |
| referencePassword | The password for your target database. |
| liquibaseProLicenseKey | Your Liquibase Pro license key (If you have one). |
| classpath | The path for your database driver |

Different commands require different parameter information to work. For more information on parameter requirements, search the Liquibase Command topics in the knowledge base.
