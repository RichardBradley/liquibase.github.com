title: Liquibase 1.0 RC1 Released
---
Liquibase 1.0 RC1 has been released. Changes since 0.9.1 are primarily code refactoring to make sure it is a clean code base to work with post-1.0. The only new feature is a batch and shell script for easier running of the command line migrator. There were also the usual documentation improvements and bug fixes.

Please <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/community.html">report</a> all bugs you find with the release candidate so they can be addressed in the 1.0 release, particularly in the <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/manual/latest/maven.html">Maven support</a>. Unless there are show-stopper bugs found, the final 1.0 release should be out in two weeks or less.
