If you are looking for inspriation, there is now an "<a href="http://liquibase.jira.com/wiki/display/CONTRIB/Ideas">Ideas Page"</a> on the Extension Portal to get you started.


If you are not planning on creating an extension, but have something that you would like to see created, please add it to the list as well.
